## Approach 

This is the static site engine for Fiction Static sites. 

It is build with built with [hexo](http://hexo.io/).

This site shares a core set of files with every other Fiction static site including this readme. 

Files that are shared include: 

- .vscode - VSCode config
- update.js - Script for updating static site libraries
- /scripts - Hexo Scripts
- /themes - Primary site design
- makefile - For building and deploying
- _config.yml - Hexo config, Common config portion after '######'
- package.json - All packages are merged across static sites.

Information that is CUSTOM to this site and won't be changed: 

- All content layout should be configurable via the custom portion of hte Hexo _config.yml file (before '######')
- Site text content lives in the 'src' folder
- CNAME for the site is used by Github
- Public, db.json are generated by HEXO

## Development 

First, install needed scripts...
```
# SETUP
$ npm install -g hexo-cli
$ npm install (or yarn)
```

This repository uses a makefile. To run a local server: 
```
# LOCAL SERVER
$ make serve
```

To deploy to the repository (also generates static files)
```
# DEPLOY TO LIVE SITE
$ make deploy
```

Only generate static files to "public" folder...
```
# GENERATE STATIC FILES
$ make generate
```
