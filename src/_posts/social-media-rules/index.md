Today’s post is a quick study on using Facebook for influencers (or those that desire to be). Note that these rules and observations likely apply elsewhere.

I’m writing this article for two reasons:

First, sites like Facebook are becoming a window to the world. If we want to keep and maintain a personal brand, then it’s important to follow some consistent good practices. These rules are not necessarily just for building your personal brand, but also to prevent you from screwing it up.

Second, without rules it’s hard to observe them. So even for myself, I wanted to write this so I had some guidelines!

# Rule 1 – Get a good profile picture, keep it, and use it everywhere.

>“Brand is just a perception, and perception will match reality over time.” – Elon Musk

An important element of all branding is consistency and reinforcement. Profile pictures are synonymous with your online personal brand. Therefore, it makes sense to get a good one that reinforces your ‘image’. Then you’ll want to use it exclusively and consistently for a long time.

Why? Because over time this will reinforce your image and become a mnemonic people will associate with you.  If they see that picture they will know it’s you. So even if you’re not famous, maybe your profile picture can be.

# Rule 2 – Post content people actually want to see.

I have some news for you. Your friends on Facebook probably don’t care about a lot of the important events in your life. And if these people are close enough to you to care, guess what? Facebook isn’t the medium.

So for that reason, stop posting the following type of posts:

- Couple photos
- Pictures of food, drinking, and partying (unless it is part of your brand)
- The same old ” you and a bunch of friends smiling and looking at the camera” shot
- Baby or pregnant photos
- Humble bragging and “I’m better than you” posts (discussed below)

An influencer knows to post content people actually find educational, interesting, motivating or entertaining.

For that reason, here’s some formats that I find particularly good for building a personal brand:

- **Good quotes.** Why? It’s always good to associate yourself with wisdom and people that are historic and well respected.
- **Well done “selfies” or model shots.** Yes, well done selfies are actually a good thing as long as they build and reinforce your  brand.
- **Sharing articles with commentary.**
- **Events and content that people can be part of.**  If your followers can be part of something then it’s interesting to them. If they can’t, well then you’re just humble bragging.

# Rule 3 – Stop the humble bragging and self promotion

One thing you should always remember is this general rule: **Your friends do NOT want to see you more successful and happy than they are.**

This can be counterintuitive since, hey, these are your friends. But this is just psychology. Your friends, even your close ones, don’t want to see you elevated to a social status where they can’t keep up. Who can blame them? In fact, you probably feel the same way about your friends.

So considering that, here are the real reasons to avoid humble bragging and self promotion with your Facebook posts.

**It undermines your success.** Real successful people don’t need to post their successes everywhere, other people do that for them.
**It makes people feel bad.** Jealousy is not a good feeling to rouse in your friends and followers. It is the quickest way to get unfollowed.
**It doesn’t serve any real purpose.** Think about it. What point does bragging and showing off on Facebook serve?

# Rule 4 – Don’t kick the hornet’s nest.

> “Never criticize, condemn, or complain.”

If there is a rule that is more important than any other when dealing with people; it is to never to criticize, condemn, or complain (the 3 C’s).

I often see people taking sides on very divisive and controversial topics. Which is a form of condemnation of the opposing view.

For influencers, this can be one of the largest mistakes you can make. Why? Because it creates enemies.

For example, think homeless people are causing problems in San Francisco? Well, even if they are, you should NOT say anything; because there may be a liberal editor at a smear magazine that wants to make a controversial post for page views. (As one of my good friends just found out.)

The same thing goes for topics like feminism, religion, politics etc. Stay away. You have been warned.

# Rule 5 – Create Content, Build Karma

If you really are an influencer or you would like to become one, then it’s important to build karma and create content associated with your personal brand.

This can be done in many ways. For example, this is one of the reasons I write these blog posts every day, with the sincere desire to give my readers a competitive advantage. (FYI: Nothing is more satisfying than giving the people that believe in you a competitive edge!)

So you might want to think about creating your own content to post on Facebook. Just remember it’s all about karma. It has to create value, which means it should be educational, interesting, motivating or entertaining.
