Since you were in high school, you’ve probably heard about Socrates and his infamous “Socratic Method.” <!-- more --> But if you’re anything like me, you probably don’t know that much about it. Maybe that it means asking questions to prove a point, but that’s not the whole story.

Recently, I noticed that so many great minds pay homage to the works of Socrates. For example, Benjamin Franklin explicitly stated that his goal was to be more like Socrates. So I did some reading, and found a lot of interesting ideas and principles.

Socratic method is a much deeper and more conceptual way of thinking than I realized, and it’s already making an important difference in the way I think and act..

# What’s the Point?

> “I can’t teach anybody anything, I can only make them think.”
– Socrates

The point of using Socrates method is that it is one of the best ways to either move someone toward your line of thinking; or improve their thinking in general about a subject.

The objective is to get someone to think. To get them to potentially reconsider a set way of thinking.

Perhaps the most interesting thing about Socratic method, is that it works. This concept has the power to move mountains. You can resolve conflicts, make sales, get better results and more if you master it. But mastering it isn’t easy, it takes practice.

So let’s go through some of the underlying concepts.

# Concept 1. I Don’t Know, You Don’t Either

> I am wiser than this man, for neither of us appears to know anything great or good; but he fancies he knows something, although he knows nothing; whereas I, as I do not know anything, so I do not fancy I do.”
– Socrates

The foundation to Socrates’ method of thinking was first based on his assumption that he “knew nothing.”  In effect, this meant that he started every conversation on the basis that he knew nothing about the subject being discussed.

While he may, or may not, have actually thought that he knew something. This assumption put him at an important, and subtle, advantage in his conversation.

When you admit you know nothing, you can’t be argued with. You can only be taught.

# Concept 2. Ask “Yes” Questions

Assuming that you “don’t know anything” becomes this basis for asking pointed questions, getting people to explain their viewpoint.

Questions tend to invoke a response, and if you ask the right questions, that response will require thinking.

What type of questions? Typically, you always want to start with “yes” questions. These are questions that confirm the assumptions of your counterpart.

Once you get someone to confirm their starting belief, your next move is to draw logical conclusions based on them.  And then, once you get the person to agree with those next conclusions, draw more conclusions.

At some point, you will have exhausted all preconceived notions for the argument and your counterpart will need to do actual consideration to answer you.

This process of getting someone to open up their mind is where the persuasive power of Socrates lies.

# Concept 3. Read & Practice

The art of Socratic method is extremely powerful in nearly all aspects of your life. But to do it effectively takes practice.  I also haven’t done any real justice into the way it’s done with this article. So I can only point you in the right direction.

I recommend you read some of the works of Socrates in these books, and see for yourself how it worked. The books I recommend:
- [Conversations With Socrates](https://www.amazon.com/Conversations-Socrates-Classics-Xenophon-ebook/dp/B002RI94JG/)
- [The Trial and Death of Socrates](https://www.amazon.com/Trial-Death-Socrates-Dialogues-Editions-ebook/dp/B008TVLOZM/)
