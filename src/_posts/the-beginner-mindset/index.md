> Do you have a “closed” state of mind?

**“Zen” is derived from an ancient word meaning absorption.**

<!-- block -->
So you might say that Zen is the art of *putting yourself in an absorptive state*. Or in other words, having a mindset that *allows you to be open*.
<!-- block -->

So what does “being open” mean?

Well, it means removing the unnecessary and unimportant from your life to make way for the new.

Reducing the clutter that prevents you from focusing on what’s really important.

***Now think about it…***

Do you have any anchors that prevent you from experiencing or trying new things?

Do the friends you already have prevent you from seeking out new connections?

It’s the age old “good is the enemy of great” scenario.

So how can we improve?

# Zen Techniques

## Beginner’s Mindset

As you become more experienced in something, your mind builds set pathways for *“the way things are.”*

That is, your mind builds experience from pattern matching.

Over time, the mind relaxes and falls into a state of automation based on these patterns. And while most the time this is a good thing, sometimes it isn’t.

Pattern matching frees your mind using automation, but over time, patterns can change.

So to find happiness and success in a changing world, it often requires you adopt a beginner’s mindset.

Build your patterns based both what you learned when you were younger, but maintain a Zen beginner’s mindset to allow you to create new ones.

# Minimalism

<em>Minimizing Focuses You</em></p>

If your life is already full of objects, you don’t have the space to put anything new.

If you already have a lot of relationships, you won’t make the effort to really build strong new ones.

This prevents you from improving. This prevents you from getting better.

*And this is why minimalism is a key ingredient in the zen mindset.*

and that’s the misconception about minimalism.

Most think its about “not having,” but in reality it’s about creating the ability to focus and improve.

If something in your life is unneeded, remove it.  This makes way for new people, more efficient tools.

So what can you remove?

Well do you actually need a car or do you just need one to get to work?
Do you need to go to work or do you just need to go to work to pay for your car?
Maybe you don’t need either.
