# The Math

<!-- block -->
Over the last 5 years I have been living in San Francisco paying over $3000/mo for a one bedroom apartment.<!-- block --> (And this is before the bubble, the same spot is now $4000/mo).

If you break that down its around $125/ni for a room that I am committed to living in and paying for.

Since I love to travel, i was ALSO traveling around 50% of the time, paying for hotels. At an average of $150/ni for hotels this means overall I was paying $3000 + 15*150 = $5250 a month for places to sleep.

Now suppose I remove the apartment from the equation, and just live in hotels. That is $150*30 = $4500/mo.

So now by living in hotels, I’m actually saving $750/mo and I don’t have to deal with a landlord, I have complete location independence and the services associated with staying at hotels.

Isn’t this a no brainer?

# The Technology

Over the last 5 to 10 years, we’ve seen a lot of new technology all centered around mobile networking, communication and services. For example: Uber, AirBNB, Facebook, Slack, etc…

And as I see it, they have made it possible, for the first time ever, for people to live and work independently of any one location.

For example, pre 2005 visiting new places took a lot of careful planning to avoid the friction associated with transportation, communication, lodging, etc.. but today I can find and/or order anything i need in 30 seconds with my phone.

Overall, this all makes it very easy to travel to new places and work in them as well.

Another hurdle to traveling removed?

# The Movement

Because the math just makes sense, I’ve now gone more-or-less fully “nomad.” This means I travel full time.

I believe that this will be a much bigger thing in the future and it just needs a little leadership.
