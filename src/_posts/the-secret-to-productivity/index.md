Over the last few years, I’ve fallen in and out of love with work. After years of hitting it hard, I admit that last year I did experience some burnout and frustration.<!-- more -->

However, today I’m happy to say things are different. All because of a change I made a few months ago.

Here I’m going to explain to you the simple, and ridiculously powerful, concept which brought me back. Now I’m more productive and passionate about my work than I’ve been for years.

# The Backstory

I’d say that my experience running PageLines has been unique. Within a year of being founded, [PageLines](https://www.pagelines.com/) went from being a small web marketing consultancy to a one-person software company doing over a million dollars in revenue. While this was a very fun experience, more than anything it was stressful.

During this period, we were doing roughly 40 new paying customers per day, and I was clearly underwater. Inevitably, some customers weren’t getting the desired experience and we were leaving tons of opportunities on the table.

Around this time I decided to move to San Francisco, because “that’s what software companies do…” Even though I love that city, it was never best for my productivity or business objectives. To be specific, I was never able to get on top of things the way I wanted.

So last year I experienced burnout. Something which I feel every entrepreneur should go through and plan on.

I was simply unmotivated; and this was a very unproductive time for me regarding work.  My schedule went like this: get up, work on ‘whatever‘, go to event/party/meeting, go to bed (at some point).

It doesn’t take a genius to see that my schedule made me very distracted and unfocused. It also prevented me from thinking clearly and getting quality work done within a reasonable time frame.

A couple months ago I decided that I needed to change something and get back on track. That’s when I re-read a favorite book of mine, and had an idea…


# The Original Self Help Book
>“every part of my business should have its allotted time.”

Benjamin Franklin is probably my most admired public figure. Years ago I read his autobiography and felt it was so interesting, that I’ve sought to emulate his life ever since.

So when I was looking for answers, I actually re-read this book and had a revelation.

At one point, Ben recounts how powerful his concept of ‘order’ was. Defining it as <em>“every part of my business should have its allotted time.”</em>

He then scheduled his day to the minute regarding what he should be working on, when he should go to bed, wake up etc..

When I first read this book, I took this idea and said ‘that’s interesting’ and kept reading. But after rereading it, that’s when it finally sunk in.

Specifically, I realized that structuring your day gives you a benchmark to judge yourself against. It’s not enough just to think about it, you actually have to write it down in concrete terms.

# My Concrete Daily Routine

>“If you don’t know where you’re going; you probably won’t get there.”

So that’s it, that is my #1 secret to productivity. Setting a daily routine, in writing, that accounts for all the various things that can come up in a week.

The schedule should take into account:

- Week days vs. week ends
- Vacation schedule
- What and when you eat & drink
- When to workout, shower, read, write, work, etc. etc..

Here’s my basic daily process (which I keep in Evernote):

- **Basic Structure**
  - Early Morning: stretch, eat, coffee, plan resolutions for the day
  - Morning Work: production (process, writing and composition).
  - Lunch: eat, check accounts, email, and social media
  - Afternoons: analysis, management, and meetings.
  - Early evening: errands, sports/workout then dinner, Email/messages
  - Evenings: Conversation, Research & Study (no drinking during the week
  - Before bed: Organize, stretch, and shower
  - Weekends
    - Do sports one day (minimum)
- **Resolutions:** <em>Include general resolutions including:</em>
  - Time for family,
  - Don’t drink during the week. If you do, drink a glass of red wine or soda water with a splash of whiskey.
  - Have good & focused workouts (carry a notepad).
  - Use a schedule to plan afternoons and mornings.
  - Never get over intoxicated.
  - 7AM. Wake up at the same time every day, regardless of bed time.
  - Don’t use the snooze button. Don’t start the day with a failure.
  - Don’t get caught out, if you go somewhere late likely you’ll get stuck.
- **Week days**
  - Monday: coordination meetings, 80/20 priority setting.
  - Tuesday: The best day for releasing new products and media. This gives the opportunity for final coordination and a remaining week for the work to be absorbed and responded to.
  - Wednesday: The best day for group meetings and education.
  - Thursday: Ideal for events and more social get togethers, since there is no competition with the weekend.
  - Friday: Best day for reflection and goal review.
- **Questions**
  - <em>When to shower: morning or night?</em>
    - Showering is a necessary task daily. However, we have the option of showering in the morning/night or another time during the day.
    - Since we are working out in evening, we may need showers after workout or before bed or both.
    - We should keep them short. Shave, soap, shampoo, rinse.
  - <em>What time to go to bed? How much sleep?</em>
    - Should be working by 8am
    - Up by 7am, means 11pm bedtime or less than 8 hours of sleep
  - <em>High leverage activities, when to plan them and add them to schedule?
    - Reserve morning time (8am to Noon) for production as usual.
  - <em>Evening Parties and weekends?</em>
    - Typical bed time will be 2am
    - Drink only wine as drinking often detracts from the following day
    - Wake up at 10am
    - 10am to noon: breakfast, socializing.
    - Noon to 6pm: activity (planned earlier in the week).
    - 6pm to 8pm: social dinner.

Now, I don’t always obey this schedule exactly (although I try). But having this allows me to see exactly how far from the goal I am. For example, if I wake up an hour late, I can figure out why and try and improve.

# Do this, it’s more important than you think!

You’re probably sitting there thinking, “Ah, that’s neat. Hmmm… what should I do for lunch.”  In other words, you’re not actually gonna do this. Why? Because you are underestimating its importance.

Take it from me and my homeboy Ben, it will do more for you than you think! Time to get writing.
