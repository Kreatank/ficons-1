One term that is thrown around a lot is “A-Player.”  This vague term is meant to describe someone that is a rockstar at their job and everyone<!-- more --> wants to work with these people, since they are the single most important thing in making your company a success.

Here’s the problem: everyone talks about these people but no one seems to know what an A-player is, so let’s go over what sets them apart…

# A-Player Characteristics

## Rule #1: They do research and they read, a lot.

> “Experience is a dear teacher, but fools will learn at no other.” – Benjamin Franklin

The most important characteristic of an A-player is that they do NOT learn primarily from experience. Why? Because experience is the most detrimental, unproductive and expensive way to learn. This is essentially saying “I learn from mistakes,” and what we don’t want are people working with us that make a ton of mistakes.

So how does someone not learn from experience? They study and do research.

**How can you tell?** Ask them: _“Tell me about the last 3 books you read on [business, their trade, etc..]?”_

The easiest way to tell if someone read books, real books, on their trade or the challenges they’ve faced. not just articles on the internet. This also shows you that someone is passionate and dedicated to their work.

## Rule #2: They can write and when they do, they write concisely.

Communication skills are like the lubrication that allows a business to run. But communication doesn’t mean long emails and meetings, communication means articulating effectively and concisely.

We’ve all worked with people in the past that think “work” consists of scheduling and going to meetings, writing long verbose emails and telling people their opinions about what to do. _We don’t want to work with these people._

**How can you tell?**  Ask them to explain their approach to a problem your company faces over email. They should write you back a well formatted, and concise email explaining clearly how they would approach it.

_Important:_ Their response should include research or links to resources, since referencing and providing context is key to good communication.

## Rule #3: They have solved hard problems before.

> “When you struggle with a problem, that’s when you understand it.” – Elon Musk

In the video below, Elon Musk explains how having solved problems in the past is the key to understanding how to do a job well, and how he uses this in interviews to evaluate true experience.

This is clearly an excellent way to evaluating if someone will be able to solve problems at your business.

**How can you tell?** Ask them, _“tell me about the problems you’ve worked on, and how you solved them?”_  Someone that has solved problems should be able to go to the ‘brass tacks’ and explain in detail how they overcame it.

## Rule #4: They make your company smarter.

Every knowledge worker you hire should, simply put: make your company smarter.

In a nutshell, this is means the person has an understanding or perspective on a problem or subject that no one else in your company has.

The challenging piece about this is that, if you don’t have the knowledge, how can you tell if someone else does?

**How can you tell?** The solution is simple, if you’re thinking about bringing someone on, you should have an expert in their field interview them, even though that expert doesn’t work or have affiliation with your company.

## Rule #5: People they have worked for will admit their work is awesome.

A-players refuse to do bad work. And while they may have had some rocky professional relationships (I know I have!), their past work is the best indicator of their future work.

**How can you tell?** You should always check your own references when hiring people, not the ones that people give you. This is because bad people will often give you softball references (like their roommate or friend) that will tell you nothing valuable if you call.

Typically, you want to call their last two bosses or clients, and get their perspective on the working relationship.

Caveat: Are YOU an A-Player?

> “Make sure you’re hiring only A-players. Hire a few B-players, he said, and they hire B’s and C’s, and pretty soon the whole operation is going to pot.” – Steve Jobs

Recheck the questions above, do you have the characteristics mentioned? If not, you should really take some time and reflect since you likely won’t be able to hire these people or manage them if you don’t.
