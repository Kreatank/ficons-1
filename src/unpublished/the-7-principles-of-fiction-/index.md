One thing I believe is most important to do at the outset of a new organization is set guiding principles in place. This is because your principles dictate your behavior, which dictates your actions which dictates your *results*.

And after all, positive results are the thing we are looking for.

So before I start, you might ask, “where do these principles come from? What makes them special?” Well, as a team we’ve been running various successful and unsuccessful projects for over 10 years and we’ve learned some things. To us, these are the principles that best fit the vision…

So with that, here are the principles:

![](./karma-banksy-gets-it.jpg)

1. **Karma** – *Give without expectation*
Delivering value in the 21st century is becoming increasingly difficult so that should be the sole focus. One principle of life and work is that if you find a way to create value; it will be returned in ways you can’t imagine. That’s karma. With Fiction, the complete focus should not be money it should be creating real value for others without expectation. <p>{% asset_img "karma-banksy-gets-it.jpg" "Karma" %}

2. **Simplicity** – *Relentless minimalism*
The world is becoming more complex. Therefore it’s important to remove all noise and focus on only the things that matter. Fiction believes in removing the unnecessary and relentlessly pursuing design perfection through minimalism. <p>{% asset_img "simplicity.jpg" "Simplicity" %}
<em>Minimal means focus</em></p>

3. **Humility** – *Participate and listen*
Success comes from a healthy combination of humility and ego. Unfortunately most people have too much of the latter and not enough of the former. Therefore, we believe in listening, always having humility and refusing to ever think that we have it “figured out.”

4. **Meaning** – *Bigger than a business*
Fiction has a goal of being something bigger than just another project or business. We’d like to shoot for the stars, maybe be an aligning force for good, or positive change. Maybe something bigger than that.

5. **Visualization** – *Visualize things from different perspectives*
One secret to creating something awesome for someone, is to visualize things from their perspective. Put yourself in someone else’s place and you’ll get some amazing ideas. <p>{% asset_img "visualization.jpg" "Visualization" %}
<em>Visualization is key to success</em></p>

6. **Fun and Weird** – *Be yourself, embrace your weirdness.*
Given the option it’s always better to remembered than simply accommodating to someone else’s perception of what you should or shouldn’t be.  Therefore, don’t be afraid to create a unique personality and culture that stands out from the majority. <p>{% asset_img "fun-and-weird.jpg" "Fun and Weird" %}
<em>Right??</em></p>

7. **Humanity** – *Be human*
In Fiction we will always treat people as humans and act human ourselves. We don’t believe in making things overly complicated or formal. We don’t believe in being anything other than who we are. <p>{% asset_img "humanity.jpeg" "Speak “Human” please" %}
<em>Speak “Human” please</em></p>
