One topic I discuss often is how to best start a company. After starting so many projects of my own, I really feel like there are some key variables in the process.<!-- more -->

By this I mean: there are things that are important and things that are NOT. However, to get started, things are quite simple…

There are only two things you need to get right:

- **Brand:** A good name and brand
- **Team:** A cohesive founding team with a strong leader

That’s it? Yes, that’s it, the rest is about avoiding the pitfalls. There is a secret to this (which I’ll describe below).

# The Foundations of an Epic Company

As we said above there are only two things you need to get right. From here on out, we’ll call these the <em>“foundations of an epic company.”</em>

Why are these the only things that matter? Because changing them later will be either impossible or very painful.  They are also incredibly important.

## The Brand
As we discussed in an earlier post on choosing the right brand name for your business. This is something you must do at the start, and it is something you’ll have to live with for a very long time.

As discussed, I chose the name eDoctr for one of my companies. Why? Because I could get the domain name (*facepalm*). Yes, it was a stupid idea but guess what? I had to live with it. Even for a small project changing the brand is a pain once you get started.

To top if off, if you and your customers don’t love a brand, guess what? They aren’t gonna use it. Don’t think it matters? You’re wrong. Perhaps you can survive with a low quality brand, but people prefer brands that are aesthetic and cohesive.

So take my advice and nail this from the start.

## The Team

It’s probably clear to you that having the right team is key. But here’s the difference, you probably don’t know exactly what the right team looks like.

Here’s some hallmarks that you actually have the wrong team:

- Your cofounders were your buddies, then you decided to work together
- Your cofounders all come from the same background as you
- There’s an even equity split with no clear leader

So what does the right team look like?

Well, it goes something like this, there are five roles in business. Those are:

1. Product
2. Marketing / Sales
3. Operations
4. Finance
5. HR

Ideally the founding team has experience enough to cover those five areas. For example, in the best case scenario, here’s how a company might start:

- You have a product person who stumbles on to an idea and gets a little traction with a project
- He gets an experienced marketing person to help him productize the project, then market and sell it.. hence, initial revenue
- Now that we have a product and maybe even revenue, you need someone to manage the operations, finance and HR. So you bring in that person.

Once you have the key roles covered, you must have a strong leader.

Having a good leader solves a lot of initial problems in a business. Namely, it often prevents group think and analysis paralysis. Also, one person needs to set the vision and the standards for the brand.

# The Secret to Everything Else
I’m going to let you in on a secret. The other big issues that come up when starting a company, namely:

- Will we be able to raise money?
- Is this the right product?
- Etc.

Are all red herrings. Don’t worry about them.

Why? Because if, at this point, you’ve managed to score some good cofounders and create a great brand platform, then I only have one piece of advice: **Start small and iterate.**

How? That depends. PageLines started as a one man web design shop because I desperately needed to make rent. That allowed me to start playing with ideas.

Your situation might be different, but I suggest that in many cases you can make money from day one, and use that to iterate.

Can you consult? Can you design, build or create for clients?

Once you get started and people are paying you actual money, you can take the next steps with clear insight.
