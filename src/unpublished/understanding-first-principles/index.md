Fiction is a site and community designed around the concept of ‘first principles’ thinking. As a starter, I wanted to tell you guys a little <!-- more -->about first principles and my background so we have some context going forward.

First, my name is Andrew Powers. I’m a seasoned entrepreneur and an artist. I am the founder of a successful web tools company called [PageLines](https://www.pagelines.com/) and have several artistic passions that keep me busy, including [The Signals](https://soundcloud.com/sxgnals).

That said, I am starting this site as a place to write and collaborate about insights in business, life and art.

## So What Are First Principles?
First principles are one of the most powerful methods for conceiving and breaking down complex topics.

There are two ways of thinking of a problem, first, by analogue. This means you break down things by the way things currently are, what you’ve seen, or by what others have done or recommend, etc.. For example, trying to understand human behavior in relationships by what you read on a website or see in a movie.

Thinking by analogue is generally ineffective and rarely leads to true solutions to problems or disruptive innovation.

In contrast, in the first principles method, you break something down into its most fundamental components.  So to understand some challenging human behavior, you may think about the way humans evolved, and work your way through history to understand a culture. Then use this information to understand why a person is behaving a certain way.

As far as we know, Aristotle was the first to write about first principles. However, Elon Musk gives a good run down of the idea in the YouTube video above.

## What Are The Advantages of First Principles?
By breaking things down with first principles, it’s possible to get much more effective ways of thinking about the world.

Some examples:

* **Innovation:** Seeing solutions that are hidden to people that only reference current market situations
* **True Understanding:** Through first principles you can understand people in a very fundamental way. This leads you to better thinking around art, business, relationships and more.

## What will we be doing on Fiction?

On Fiction, we plan on creating a community around this concept.

You can use Fiction to

* Discover first principles concepts
* Connect with like minded people
* Find events and other media to help you elsewhere

That’s it for today, I plan on writing at least weekly on various first principles topics. Let me know if you have suggestions!
